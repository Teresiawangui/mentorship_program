        <h1>Trevoh Noah's book summary</h1>
        <p>In Chapter 1</br>
            <h1>RUN</h1>
             Trevor informs us about apartheid and how it impacted his life. One lesson we might learn is the need for resiliency. 
            <br/>Trevor was able to maintain his sense of humor in the face of many challenges and restrictions. I make the daily decision to keep happy in spite of all the difficulties.</br>
            <p>In Chapter 2</p>
            <h2>BORN A CRIME</h2>
            The focus shifts to Trevor's mother. Her story demonstrates the depth of a mother's love and the lengths she will go to in order to protect her kid.
        </br> The mother's unfailing support and fiery independence serve as an inspiration to never give up and to always speak up for what you believe in.
    </br> She also possesses traits common to most mothers in my sub county who decide to raise their kids in spite of all the ridicule they receive from the public for the things they do wrong.
</br>  These chapters stress the importance of owning your uniqueness and standing up to injustice in general.</br> Trevor's experiences highlight the importance of family in life and how it shapes our attitudes and behaviors.</br>
<h4>In Relation To our County</h4>
According to our county most of the tribes there before were not allowed to intermarry but later on that changed.Also in our daily lives despite any struggles and problems, we still approach each and every day positively. On our mothers side they are always there for us and they can do anything to protect and support us.
